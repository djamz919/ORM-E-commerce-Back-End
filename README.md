## Usage
The project must be run locally. Be sure to create a .env file in the same directory as the index.js file and populate the .env file with the DB_NAME, DB_USER, and DB_PW. Also be sure to source the schema using the terminal and populate the tables with the seeds by running `npm run seed`. Run the program by entering the command `node server.js` in your CLI. To test the APIs in the application, simply use an API platform like Insomnia Core or Postman to interact with the database.
